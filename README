A simple/sample Dojo application.

Install
-------

To fetch Dojo and all required plugins, run getdojo.sh in src/
To run a build and update Dojo, run build.sh in src/
	* Adjust the path to dojo.js and main.css in index after build. 
		- New dojo.js is located in src/release/twit/dojo/dojo.js
		- New main.css is located in src/release/twit/styles/main.css 

Updates
-------

If a new plugin from dojox (or any other external dependency) is added, you must run 
getdojo.sh to update changes. 

If your index.html is pointing to a built dojo.js (/release/twit/) you must re-run build.sh 
to "compile" the changes after every update.
